# EFB API
The EFB API is currently not available via the NPM registry. There are plans to publish it in early 2025 but in the meantime you will need to manually copy your version of the API into this folder.

Please copy `%MSFS_SDK%\Samples\DevmodeProjects\EFB\PackageSources\efb_api\dist` into this directory to replicate the following structure:

```
efb_api
├── dist
├──── AppView
├──── Components
├──── ...
├── package.json
├── README.md
```
